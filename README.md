Wright is a lightweight programming language heavily inspired by Rust. Wright aims to take advantage of some of 
Rust's key features such as safety and speed, and augment them a number of other features and additions to the
backend and type system.

##### The core goals of the language:
* Ease of use
* Robustness
* Reasonable speed
* Memory Safety
* Concurrency
* Portability

### Installation:
There are several installation options.
1. Get the latest stable version from [the releases page](https://github.com/Alfriadox/wright-lang/releases).
2. If you have rust, via `cargo install wright`.
3. Building from source, by cloning this repository, and running `cargo build --release` in the wright directory, and 
then adding wright/target/release to your system path.
