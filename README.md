# The Wright Programming language
### A Programming language that flies

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Alfriadox/Wright-lang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Alfriadox/Wright-lang)

Wright is a programming language 
that is significantly influenced by:
* Rust
* Java
* Haskell
* C / C++
* Python

Wright is a high-level language that can be either interpreted 
or compiled and uses llvm for optimizations in order to make it as 
fast as possible. 

The core ideals of the language are:
* Ease of use:
    * Wright should be as easy to pick up and use as Python
* Power:
    * Wright should be able to do as much as C / C++ and Haskell and more
* Speed: 
    * Wright should be as fast as possible, at minimum being comparable to 
    Python, and hopefully closer to Rust and C in most cases.
* Safety:
    * Wright should inherit the resource safety that Rust is known for.
    
    
### Community:
Wright promotes a happy and healthy community that is free of bullying and discrimination. 

### Dependencies:
* Rust (1.15.0 or greater)
